                <br>
                <p>


                    I. Domain-specific vs. Goal-oriented
                    Startups move fast â€” they need to adjust strategies based on the market feedback and iterate
                    constantly
                    to ensure product-market fit. Data Scientists, as an expensive resource, need to shift their focus
                    area
                    accordingly to create the largest business value.

                    Taking my own experience as an example:

                    When I first joined Brex, the priority was to onboard as many customers as we could while
                    controlling
                    for fraud risk. Therefore, I worked closely with the Onboarding team to optimize the account
                    application
                    flow and improve resource allocation for the Operations team.
                    As our customer base grew, the next priority was to scale our customer support (CX) function to
                    provide
                    the best-in-class support. I partnered with the CX team to analyze customer pain points and reduce
                    product frictions. (Read my article for more details on DS in CX.)

                <br>
                <p>

                    Climate change causes sea level rise primarily through two interconnected mechanisms: thermal
                    expansion
                    and the
                    melting of land-based ice.

                    As global temperatures rise, the ocean absorbs a massive amount of this heat, causing the water to
                    expand and occupy
                    more volume. Simultaneously, rising temperatures melt glaciers and ice sheets on land, releasing
                    vast
                    quantities of
                    freshwater that flow into the oceans, further increasing their volume.

                    Thermal Expansion
                    Thermal expansion is a fundamental property of water, and it's a major contributor to sea level
                    rise.

                <h2 class="heading">Tyrannosaurus</h2>
                <br>
                <p>

                    The Tyrannosaurus, commonly referred to as Tyrannosaurus rex, or T-rex, is possibly the most famous
                    dinosaur in the
                    world. The name is actually their genus and species name, Tyrannosaurus rex, and scientists believe
                    there may be
                    another species in the Tyrannosaurus genus!

                    While the possibly related Tarbosaurus might technically be a member of Tyrannosaurus, this article
                    will
                    be
                    discussing Tyrannosaurus rex. Read on to learn about the Tyrannosaurus.

                    Description of the Tyrannosaurus
                    While no one has seen this species in person, scientists have a decent estimation of the overall
                    appearance of
                    Tyrannosaurus. Based on fossilized specimens, the scientists estimate that T-rex stood approximately
                    12
                    ft. tall at
                    the hip, and grew about 40 ft. long. These massive creatures were some of the largest land
                    carnivores to
                    roam this
                    earth. The Tyrannosaurus had a large head, very small front legs, and muscular rear legs.</p>
