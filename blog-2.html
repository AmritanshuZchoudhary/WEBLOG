            <h1>The Unprecedented Surge and Threat of Space Debris</h1>
            <br>
            <p>

                Million of years ago, life on Earth took the bold leap to step on land, a historical evolution which set
                in motion the evolution of early terrestrial animal life forms. Today it not only dares venture beyond
                Earth itself but has rather mended the opportunities in space to the best of its use. Amidst the cheer,
                however, a concerning issue is on the rise. Space debris not only endangers our current ambitions it
                also raises the question of security and viability of future missions. Timely action is now an urgent
                necessity.

                Satellites have revolutionized the way we look at the world. These satellites continue to develop our
                understanding of our own Earth and the universe in the best way possible. At Space India, in “Space
                Explorers Workshop”, and “Space Satellites”, Students learn about various types of satellites that have
                many different uses that including communication, weather forecasting, navigation, and a lot more. They
                investigate what is a satellite and learn about the basic parts of the satellite by assembling these
                parts to make a model of a satellite. This fosters satellite education among young learners.

                Debris in space? What is it exactly?

                According to the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines adopted in 2007 and issued by the Committee on the
                Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPOUS), ‘Space Debris’ refers to all man-made objects, including
                fragments and elements thereof, in Earth orbit or re-entering the atmosphere, that are non-functional.
                In simpler words, it refers to defunct satellites, swirling parts of rockets, paint flecks, and an array
                of fragments arising from our past endeavours which are no longer under our control. It is also
                generated by the collision of objects in space and explosions- including anti-satellite tests in a more
                recent context.

                As of 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) reports for nearly 1.2 million fragments larger than 1cm and
                over 50000 larger than 10cm. The numbers and the volume occupied by this junk has been on a steady rise
                ever since the advent of the space age in the late 1950s. A major portion of this lies in the Lower
                Earth Orbit (LEO), posing a great threat to a majority of our satellites and even to the space stations
                having humans onboard. The International Space Station (ISS) for example has had to correct its course
                32 times since 1999 to evade collisions.

                For a basic visualization of the threat, a softball-sized piece of space junk has an impact energy of
                close to that of a missile. Over the past few decades, the world has also seen an unprecedented number
                of space launches on a yearly basis, which makes it imperative to regularly monitor all space objects, a
                tedious task.
