            <h1> What Being a Data Scientist at a Startup Really Looks Like</h1>
            <br>
            <p>

                I. Domain-specific vs. Goal-oriented
                Startups move fast — they need to adjust strategies based on the market feedback and iterate constantly
                to ensure product-market fit. Data Scientists, as an expensive resource, need to shift their focus area
                accordingly to create the largest business value.

                Taking my own experience as an example:

                When I first joined Brex, the priority was to onboard as many customers as we could while controlling
                for fraud risk. Therefore, I worked closely with the Onboarding team to optimize the account application
                flow and improve resource allocation for the Operations team.
                As our customer base grew, the next priority was to scale our customer support (CX) function to provide
                the best-in-class support. I partnered with the CX team to analyze customer pain points and reduce
                product frictions. (Read my article for more details on DS in CX.)
                Later, I collaborated with the Implementation team to accelerate ramp-up for new customers and with the
                product team to identify churn drivers and improve retention.
                As you can see, startups are very goal-oriented. At large firms, you might specialize in one product
                feature for years; At a startup, the company’s needs can completely change within a quarter, and data
                scientists change their domains more frequently as a result.

                The upside is that this allows the data scientists to explore and collaborate with more functions and
                have a more holistic view of the business. I worked with nearly every team at Brex in the past five
                years — watching how GTM (go-to-market) found prospects and closed deals, seeing how Product and
                Customer Support worked together to address customer pain points, and learning how the Customer Success
                team reduced churn and drove upsell. This is a far more effective way to understand business operations
                than reading books or taking courses at a business school. It also ensures the data scientists have
                clear and high-impact business questions to solve.

                But what’s the challenge? Data scientists need to follow the company’s strategy and adapt to changes
                constantly. This means shifting priorities accordingly, and sometimes having to build things the fastest
                way, instead of the most scalable or reliable way. Tech debt piles up quickly with tons of one-off
                dashboards and multiple versions of the same metric, confusing stakeholders and the data team itself.
                Establishing the best practices takes time, so living with the chaos sometimes is unavoidable — though
                being able to set up the standards from 0 to 1 (or seeing others doing so) is also a rewarding part of
                working at a startup, especially for aspiring data science leaders.

                II. Data Analyst vs. Data Engineer vs. Data Scientist? All the Above.
                Job titles in data these days are confusing — Some Data Scientists focus on experimentation, while some
                are deep in machine learning; Some Data Analysts simply build dashboards, but some primarily do product
                analytics. But when it comes to startups, titles matter less — you will likely do everything.

                When I joined Brex, everyone had the same title, “Data Scientist”, but we all had to wear multiple hats.
                We split the data team into DS, DA, and DE functions only since early last year. As I mentioned above,
                startups are goal-oriented. Therefore, when there are limited people and no clear team structure, you
                will need to do everything to achieve the goal.

                Data Engineering: I learned data modeling, Airflow, ETL processes, SQL optimization, and many other data
                engineering skills in the past five years. I remember one of my first projects at Brex was to migrate
                our data pipelines from dbt to an internal tool. Yes, as a data scientist at a startup, there is a high
                chance you also need to build, own, and maintain your own data pipelines.
                Analytics: Joining a startup means there are many business areas with no or minimal data support.
                Therefore, to help the team better understand their performance and gain their trust, the very first
                step (after you have built the data pipelines) is to define the success metrics and build the
                dashboards. Once the metrics are closely monitored, questions like why they moved or how to move them
                come next naturally. These are all common analytics tasks.
                Data Science: There are also plenty of advanced data science use cases at startups. Machine learning
                models are helpful to detect fraud, predict churn, estimate LTV (lifetime value), etc. Causal inference
                is also critical to evaluate the impact of a marketing campaign or a product launch.
                Is it a good or bad thing to wear multiple hats?

                If you are not yet sure about which type of data track you are most interested in, joining a startup
                will help you to get some flavor of everything and decide which route to go next. Or if you would like
                to become a Head of Data or even build your own company someday, this full-cycle exposure is super
                valuable.

                Meanwhile, the downside is also very clear — you will spend time on things you are not interested in, or
                not that relevant to your long-term career goal. The fact that you own the whole data lifecycle can also
                confuse stakeholders, as they usually only care about a certain type of output, for example, dashboards
                or models, but do not realize you need to spend another 50% of time on data pipelining.

                III. Higher visibility
                Data scientists at startups never lack visibility. From day one at Brex, I got to work directly with the
                C-suite. Leadership will often come to you with urgent and important business questions, hoping you can
                do some data magic to uncover insights and drive business growth. This is not something you usually get
                to experience at an established company, especially as a junior data scientist. It is a high-pressure
                but highly rewarding environment.

                For example, during the Silicon Valley Bank Crisis in March 2023, many startups were impacted, facing
                the risk of losing their operational funds. I worked very closely with the leadership team to help
                startups survive this hard time. I created a real-time tracker on new customer applications, analyzed
                application review velocity to estimate additional workforce needs, and collaborated with other DS to
                automate and speed up onboarding checks. It was an intense weekend, working cross-functionally in a war
                room (virtually on Zoom) from 8 am to midnight. However, this is one of my best memories at Brex,
                showing the true customer obsession from our leadership, and how data scientists can contribute directly
                and drive huge business impact.</p>
