                The Tyrannosaurus, commonly referred to as Tyrannosaurus rex, or T-rex, is possibly the most famous
                dinosaur in the
                world. The name is actually their genus and species name, Tyrannosaurus rex, and scientists believe
                there may be
                another species in the Tyrannosaurus genus!

                While the possibly related Tarbosaurus might technically be a member of Tyrannosaurus, this article will
                be
                discussing Tyrannosaurus rex. Read on to learn about the Tyrannosaurus.

                Description of the Tyrannosaurus
                While no one has seen this species in person, scientists have a decent estimation of the overall
                appearance of
                Tyrannosaurus. Based on fossilized specimens, the scientists estimate that T-rex stood approximately 12
                ft. tall at
                the hip, and grew about 40 ft. long. These massive creatures were some of the largest land carnivores to
                roam this
                earth. The Tyrannosaurus had a large head, very small front legs, and muscular rear legs.

                Interesting Facts About the Tyrannosaurus
                Despite being arguably the most famous dinosaur to walk the earth, most people know very little about
                T-rex. Learn
                more about what made these massive predators so impressive below.
                The Largest Carnivore to Walk on Land? – The longest known Tyrannosaur skeleton measures in at
                approximately 40 ft.
                long. However, this doesn’t mean they were the largest predatory dinosaurs! One Spinosaurus fossil
                measured 55 feet
                long, and had crocodile-like jaws.
                Mega Mystery – Just because the largest fossil we have found measured 40 ft. long, doesn’t mean that
                there were not
                larger specimens out there. Fossilization takes specific conditions, and only a small percentage of
                dinosaur remains
                underwent fossilization for humans to discover later. Scientists estimate that any single Tyrannosaurus
                could have
                measured 10 – 20% larger than the “maximum” size discovered.
                What’s in a Name? – With such a large and menacing dinosaur comes a large and menacing name. In Greek
                and Latin,
                Tyrannosaurus rex roughly translates to “king of the tyrant lizards.” This is referring to T-rex’s
                incredible size,
                and incredibly long teeth.
                Toothy Grin – One of the more menacing aspects of T-rex is theirimmense pair of jaws. This creature had
                an
                impressively large head. In fact, their head was disproportionately large, and required an extremely
                muscular neck
                to support it. The Tyrannosaurus had jaws lined with sharp teeth, which could grow up to 12 in. long!
                Habitat of the Tyrannosaurus
                These dinosaurs likely utilized a wide range of habitats. The landscape of their range was very
                different 65 million
                years ago, as was much of the world. Scientists believe that the T-rex lived in areas with high humidity
                and
                semi-tropical temperatures. They lived in coastal swamps, open forests, and likelyremained close to
                water sources.
                These water sources likely attracted wide variety of prey for these carnivores to feed on.

                Distribution of the Tyrannosaurus
                Researchers found all of the Tyrannosaurus rex fossils today in North America. There are thirteen known
                specimens,
                all of which hid under the earth in the United States and Canada. This does not necessarily mean that
                these
                creatures did not roam the entire American continent, but simply that these areas met conditions for
                fossilization.
                Archaeologists have found seven specimens in Montana, four in South Dakota, one in Wyoming, and one in
                Saskatchewan.


                Diet of the Tyrannosaurus
                These reptiles likely fed on a wide variety of prey. This is because they would have required large
                amounts of food
                to maintain such a large size, and likely couldn’t afford to be picky. Scientists believe that T-rex had
                the
                strongest bite of any terrestrial animal known to man. This allowed them to feed on the carcasses of
                large
                dinosaurs, and more efficiently kill prey. Researchers still debate whether this dinosaur scavenged more
                frequently,
                or primarily hunted live prey.
